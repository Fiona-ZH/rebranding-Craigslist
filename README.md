## Summary
This is a redesign of the logo and style guide of a popular website for classified ads: Craigslist.

## Context
Craigslist is one of the most popular websites in the world with millions of visitors posting and viewing classified adds each month. Over the years, Craigslist has maintained its bare-boned design approach despite of the various design trends come and gone on the internet. However, as the design style became out-dated, it lacks visual appeal to its large number of visitors.

## Goal
The redesign aims at bringing a modern look and feeling to the brand's logo and style, making it more appealing to new users, while drastic changes are avoided in order to maintain Craigslist's in-place brand recognition.

## Approach
The logo is the capital C from the brand's name consists of a curved bullet list, which clearly conveys the vision and mission of the brand, as well as the functionality of the website: listing. The logo has good readability with several colour combinations to be used for app icons, printing on stationaries and accessaries.

The colour palette inherited Craigslist's classic blue, while a visual hierarchy is achieved with the addition of Lilac and Cyan.
